# Bayes

On Navive Bayes, multiple distribution Cuachy, beta, weibull_min did not work out, beta after fitting for alpha and beta only gave 10% accuracy, more like random selection of 10% within 10 class, putting constant alpha/beta, putting variables as mean and var of columns also did not workout. rescaled the scale to 1.2, and move center to loc=-0.1  to make sure logpdf not going to infinity but did not help the accuracy. Cauchy got about max 0.4 accuracy. Best is gaussian since is not unoform and and we have majority of population zero give some weight to the middle of population, Non-naive got to 0.9 with cov matrix.
